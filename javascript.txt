Variables: A container that stores some data

var,let & const

var -> Function scoped
let -> Block scoped
const -> Block scoped & It's a constant value

type of variable  (name of variable) = Value
var name = "Bob"


- Data types 
1. String, number, boolean, null, undefined (Primitive Data types)
2. Objects & Arrays (Non-Primitive data types)

- Operators 
1. Arithmetic Operators ( + , - , * , / , % ,**)
2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, %=)
3. Comparison Operators ( == , === )
4. Logical Operators (&& (AND), || (OR), !(NOT) )


- Conditional statements (if, else if, else)
- Loops (For, while, do while)
- break & continue

- Function scoped vs block scoped
- Arrays
- Objects
- Template literals
- Spread operator
- Pure & Impure Functions

- hoisting (Variable hoisting (var, let & const) & function hoisting (Function declaration, function expression))
- Arrow Function
- Destructuring
- Asynchronous Javascript

- Callbacks

Callbacks are a function that is passed in another function as an argument.
It performs a specific task after an Asynchronous operation is completed.

- Promises

Promises is an object which represents if an Asynchronous task is completed or it is failed

- then & catch
It's a way to consume a promised & used to handle our Promise state
 (if it is resolved the .then works if rejected then .catch works)

- async/await

It's also a way to consume the Promise 
if promise is resolved we can do try otherwise incase of rejected we do to catch
Await will pause the execusion of our code further till out promise is either resolved or rejected



- Array traversal methods

forEach, map, filter, reduce, find


- DOM manipulation
